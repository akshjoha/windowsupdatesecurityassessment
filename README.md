# README for KB Article Analysis Tool

This repository provides a Python-based tool to analyze Windows Update KB articles, predict vulnerabilities using machine learning, and generate a detailed HTML report. The tool integrates data extraction, processing, prediction, and sentiment analysis to help users manage and understand their Windows environment's updates and potential risks.

# Features

Retrieve Windows Version: Identifies the installed Windows version for compatibility checks.
Installed Updates Extraction: Lists installed KB updates using PowerShell.
CSV Comparison: Compares installed KB numbers with a provided CSV file of all KB updates.
Future Vulnerability Prediction: Uses a pre-trained Random Forest model to predict future vulnerability scores.
Web Scraping: Retrieves user feedback and article metadata from Microsoft Answers for KB updates.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes user feedback sentiment for KB articles using a pre-trained logistic regression model.
HTML Reporting: Generates a detailed and interactive HTML report, including tables, graphs, and pie charts.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or later
Required Python libraries (install via requirements.txt):
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
selenium
scikit-learn
joblib
webdriver_manager
Chrome WebDriver: Automatically managed by webdriver_manager.
PowerShell: Necessary for extracting installed KB updates.


# The tool will:

Retrieve your Windows version and installed KB updates.
Compare installed KB numbers with those in the CSV file.
Predict future vulnerabilities based on a machine learning model.
Scrape user feedback for relevant KB articles.
Perform sentiment analysis on the scraped data.
Generate an HTML report (kb_report.html) in the root directory.
